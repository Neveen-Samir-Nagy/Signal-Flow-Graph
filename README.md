# Signal-Flow-Graph
A signal-flow graph or signal-flow-graph (SFG), invented by Claude Shannon,[1] but often called a Mason graph after Samuel Jefferson Mason who coined the term,[2] is a specialized flow graph, a directed graph in which nodes represent system variables, and branches (edges, arcs, or arrows) represent functional connections between pairs of nodes. Thus, signal-flow graph theory builds on that of directed graphs (also called digraphs), which includes as well that of oriented graphs. This mathematical theory of digraphs exists, of course, quite apart from its applications
